I am currently an AP at the [School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou University](https://www7.zzu.edu.cn/csai/). I received my Ph.D. from the Natural Language Processing Laboratory at [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/), supervised by [Junhui Li](https://web.suda.edu.cn/jhli/) and [Min Zhang](https://zhangminsuda.github.io/). During my doctoral studies, I conducted research internships at Huawei 2012 Lab and the Advanced Translation Technology (ATT) Research Group at the National Institute of Communications Technology (NICT), Japan. After completing my Ph.D., I joined the Huawei 2012 Lab. My research interests include machine translation, with a particular focus on enhancing long-text and document-level translation.

### 🔈 JOIN US!
Inspired by the philosophy that understanding emerges through creation, my research aims to advance the foundations and applications of large language models. I am particularly interested in exploring how foundation models can be designed, adapted, and evaluated to better support complex reasoning and long-context generation. My work seeks to bridge model capabilities with practical generation and evaluation challenges in real-world, document-level scenarios.

**Do not hesitate to drop me an email for any possible collaboration if you are interested in these directions:**

- **Foundation Models**: large-scale pretraining, architectural design, and capability analysis
- **Long-Context Generation and Evaluation**: document-level and long-text generation, coherence modeling, and automatic evaluation
- **Multimodal Foundation Models**: unified modeling across text, speech, and vision, and cross-modal understanding and generation
