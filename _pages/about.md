I am currently an AP at the [School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou University](https://www7.zzu.edu.cn/csai/). I received my Ph.D. from the Natural Language Processing Laboratory at [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/), supervised by [Junhui Li](https://web.suda.edu.cn/jhli/) and [Min Zhang](https://zhangminsuda.github.io/). During my doctoral studies, I conducted research internships at Huawei 2012 Lab and the Advanced Translation Technology (ATT) Research Group at the National Institute of Communications Technology (NICT), Japan. After completing my Ph.D., I joined the Huawei 2012 Lab. My research interests include machine translation, with a particular focus on enhancing long-text and document-level translation.
